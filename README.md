# request-ip-nextjs

A Next.js middleware for retrieving a request's IP address.

## Motivation

`request-ip` is a popular package for retrieving a request's IP address. However, it is not
compatible with Next.js `NextRequest`. This package is a Next.js middleware that provides the same
functionality as `request-ip`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install request-ip-nextjs
```
